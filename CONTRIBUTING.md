# Contributing

## Important information

When contributing **make sure to submit your contributions to the [GitLab repo](https://gitlab.com/Atrate/i3blocks-ufw)**. Other repos (such as on GitHub) are just read-only mirrors from GitLab.

## Code style

Please indent your code with 4 spaces, not the TAB character. Please place opening braces in a new line, like this:
```
function foo()
{
    bar();
}
```
